    question: "What do Developer Relations & Growth Campaigns include?",
    answer:
      "Our developer relations and growth service covers community building, developer education, advocacy, project tutorials, product launches, organic distribution, creator collaborations, integrations, and event support. We operate as an embedded extension of your team.",
  },
  {
    question: "How is this different from hiring an in-house DevRel team?",
    answer:
      "With Studio1, you get a hands-on DevRel team with writers, engineers, community managers, and advocates without the overhead of hiring, onboarding, and managing multiple roles. We ramp up fast, require minimal oversight, and stay leaner than building every function in-house.",
  },
  {
    question: "What kind of community building do you do?",
    answer:
      "We help set up, grow, and support developer communities on Discord, Slack, GitHub Discussions, forums, Reddit, X, LinkedIn, and event channels. This includes onboarding flows, engagement programs, developer replies, feedback loops, AMAs, hackathons, and community partnerships.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you support hackathons and community collaborations?",
    answer:
      "Yes. We can help with hackathon collaborations, student community partnerships, tech community outreach, meetup support, and developer event partnerships, especially across India.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do you measure DevRel success?",
    answer:
      "We look at community growth and engagement, content reach, developer adoption signals, event feedback, GitHub activity, and product feedback surfaced from community conversations.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you work alongside our existing DevRel team?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely. Most of our engagements complement existing DevRel or marketing teams. Your team handles product positioning while we handle execution: community programs, campaign coordination, launch support, creator management, and distribution at scale.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the onboarding process like?",
    answer:
      "We start with a Discovery phase where we audit your existing developer programs, analyze community engagement, and identify growth opportunities. Within the first two weeks, we deliver an actionable assessment and a tailored DevRel roadmap aligned to your goals.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you run growth campaigns and influencer programs?",
    answer:
      "Yes. We run multi-channel organic campaigns across X, LinkedIn, Reddit, YouTube, newsletters, and developer communities. For influencer management, we handle creator discovery, outreach, pricing, briefs, coordination, and reporting across X, LinkedIn, YouTube, and other relevant channels.",
  },
